NumPy\n","\n","NumPy is a powerful library for numerical operations and handling arrays.\n","\n","#### Basics of NumPy\n","\n","**Installation:**\n","```bash\n","pip install numpy\n","```\n","\n","**Importing NumPy:**\n","```python\n","import numpy as np\n","```\n","\n","**Creating Arrays:**\n","```python\n","# Creating a 1D array\n","arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n","\n","# Creating a 2D array\n","arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n","\n","print(arr1)\n","print(arr2)\n","```\n","\n","**Array Operations:**\n","```python\n","# Element-wise operations\n","arr3 = arr1 * 2\n","print(arr3)\n","\n","# Mathematical functions\n","print(np.sqrt(arr1))\n","```\n","\n","### 2. Pandas\n","\n","Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame, which is similar to tables in databases or spreadsheets.\n","\n","#### Basics of Pandas\n","\n","**Installation:**\n","```bash\n","pip install pandas\n","```\n","\n","**Importing Pandas:**\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","```\n","\n","**Creating DataFrames:**\n","```python\n","# From a dictionary\n","data = {\n","    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],\n","    'Age': [25, 30, 35],\n","    'Height': [5.5, 6.0, 5.8]\n","}\n","\n","df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n","print(df)\n","```\n","\n","**Reading and Writing Data:**\n","```python\n","# Reading from a CSV file\n","df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n","print(df)\n","\n","# Writing to a CSV file\n","df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)\n","```\n","\n","**DataFrame Operations:**\n","```python\n","# Selecting columns\n","ages = df['Age']\n","print(ages)\n","\n","# Filtering rows\n","adults = df[df['Age'] > 18]\n","print(adults)\n","\n","# Adding a new column\n","df['Weight'] = [65, 70, 75]\n","print(df)\n","\n","# Grouping and Aggregating\n","grouped = df.groupby('Name').mean()\n","print(grouped)\n","```\n","\n","### 3. Matplotlib/Seaborn\n","\n","Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.\n","\n","#### Basics of Matplotlib\n","\n","**Installation:**\n","```bash\n","pip install matplotlib seaborn\n","```\n","\n","**Importing Matplotlib and Seaborn:**\n","```python\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","```\n","\n","**Creating Plots:**\n","```python\n","# Line plot\n","plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 9, 16])\n","plt.xlabel('X-axis')\n","plt.ylabel('Y-axis')\n","plt.title('Line Plot')\n","plt.show()\n","\n","# Scatter plot with Seaborn\n","sns.scatterplot(x='Age', y='Height', data=df)\n","plt.title('Age vs Height')\n","plt.show()\n","```\n","\n","### Example: Analyzing and Visualizing DNA Sequence Data\n","\n","Let's combine these libraries in a practical example. We'll read a CSV file containing DNA sequences and their properties, perform some analysis, and visualize the results.\n","\n","**Example Data (`dna_data.csv`):**\n","```csv\n","Sequence,Length,GC_Content\n","ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAG,20,50.0\n","GCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCA,20,55.0\n","TGCATGCATGCTAGCTAGCA,20,45.0\n","```\n","\n","**Python Script:**\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","\n","# Read the CSV file\n","df = pd.read_csv('dna_data.csv')\n","\n","# Calculate basic statistics\n","mean_gc = df['GC_Content'].mean()\n","std_gc = df['GC_Content'].std()\n","\n","print(f\"Mean GC Content: {mean_gc:.2f}%\")\n","print(f\"Standard Deviation of GC Content: {std_gc:.2f}%\")\n","\n","# Visualize the data\n","plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\n","\n","# Histogram of GC content\n","plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\n","sns.histplot(df['GC_Content'], kde=True)\n","plt.title('GC Content Distribution')\n","plt.xlabel('GC Content (%)')\n","\n","# Boxplot of sequence lengths\n","plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\n","sns.boxplot(x=df['Length'])\n","plt.title('Sequence Length Distribution')\n","plt.xlabel('Length (bp)')\n","\n","plt.tight_layout()\n","plt.show()\n","```\n","\n","### Explanation:\n","- **Reading Data**: We read the DNA sequence data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.\n","- **Calculating Statistics**: We calculate the mean and standard deviation of the GC content using Pandas.\n","- **Visualizing Data**: We create a histogram of the GC content and a boxplot of the sequence lengths using Matplotlib and Seaborn.\n","\n","This script demonstrates the integration of data handling, analysis, and visualization in Python.
